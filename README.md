# selenium_python_mb

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Selenium
- Pytest
- Allure

## Test Website
- [mb-qa.eu](https://mb-qa.eu/)

## Getting Started
To set up the project, you can manually install all the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file or run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Tests
To run these tests, I recommend using the startup script `simple_run.sh` or `simple_run.bat`, depending on your system and terminal. You can execute it with the following commands:

Bash: `bash simple_run.sh`

Windows: `.\simple_run.bat`

## Note
I'm currently working on fixing the scripts to run the tests with the Allure report.
